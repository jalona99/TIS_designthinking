# Reflections

Regarding the course, I would like to expand my understanding about many aspects in design thinking projects. There are viewpoints from the first until the final base to execute how to develop and manage a development of systems behind the technology not only in terms of  the individual skill but also as a team project management. Therefore, we can establish our knowledge in the future to prepare for the tech company which follows current market growth.
